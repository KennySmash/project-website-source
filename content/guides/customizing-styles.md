# Customizing Annotation Styles

Need a bit more flexibility with the visual appearance of your annotations than Annotorious provides out of the box? Customizing
styles is easy! Depending on what you need, you have two options:

1. Change the styles globally, by overriding or replacing the built-in __CSS stylesheet__
2. Write your own JavaScript __Formatter__ function to apply styles based on specific rules
